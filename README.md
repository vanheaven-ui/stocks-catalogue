## Background <a name = "about"></a>

The application herein was developed as per [Microverse Inc.](https://www.microverse.org/) specificifications. The main task was to use `create-react-app` and build and a single page application that displays a catalogue of items received from an API of choice. This application consumes the [Financial Modelling Prep API](https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/) to gather information on real time stocks which are displayed in React components. Redux was used to centrally manage the application state. To enhance the browsing of stocks, filters were added. 

## Live Demo
